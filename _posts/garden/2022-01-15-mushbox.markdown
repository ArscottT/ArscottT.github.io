description: My friends recently started growing mushrooms and it just looked so cool! And after having eaten my own freshly grown Oyster mushrooms after the recent batch, I can tell you that it's definitely worth the effort! I wanted to make the whole box myself, so I needed to implement the humidity control and design the box. Which turned out to be an interesting process of trial and error, and several faulty misting devices.

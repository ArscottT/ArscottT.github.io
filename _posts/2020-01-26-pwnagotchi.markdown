description: When I saw the project for the Pwnagotchi I couldn't help it, I had to make one. The face was just too cute, and after having a Tamagotchi as a child it brought back memories. This project was a test of my 3D design skills and my soldering skills. I designed the case and added an external antenna and a real time clock.

description: I love festivals, but it's always hard to find your friends. So what's the best way to find them, and to stand out in the crowdâ€¦ A rave Totem. There's so much potential for improvement, that this is going to be a project that goes on for a while. But I already love the effect of the old school EL wire glowing at night.
